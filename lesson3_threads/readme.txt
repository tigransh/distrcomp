Assume there are two people standing in the same place on the plane: x=0, y=0.
Every 100 milliseconds they do a step of 1 meter on one of the directions:
    East, West, South, North randomly.
Calculate and print their current coordinate.
Write the program in one thread, then in two separate threads for each person.
